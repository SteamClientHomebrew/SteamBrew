# Installing

A quick guide to installing Millennium.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

### Automatic

To install Millennium on windows, we use a PowerShell installer script. To run the script, open PowerShell, paste the following command, and press enter.

This installer is entirely open source and we encourage the community audit the [source code](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/blob/main/scripts/install.ps1).

**Millennium is entirely portable, and the following script doesn't change any system configuration.**

```powershell
iwr -useb "https://steambrew.app/install.ps1" | iex
```

### Manual

Start by downloading the Millennium's Windows assets from [this repository](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/releases/latest) under the name `millennium-v0.0.0-windows-x86_64.zip`. Simply put all files into your Steam directory, which [here](../faq/finding-version.md)

:::caution
We don't support Steam installed via [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) or [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/).
We also don't support any ARM based distributions as they require custom Steam installations.
:::

:::note
Looking to package Millennium for your favorite distribution? It should be a relatively simple process, the filesystem hierarchy is easily change-able [here](https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium/blob/main/src/sys/env.cc). From there you can build Millennium to use any filesystem standard!

### NixOS

We officially offer nix package for millennium. Currently, it isn't available in nixpkgs, but you can use our flake.

1. Add input to your flake.

```nix
inputs.millennium.url = "git+https://github.com/SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium";
```

:::note
Don't use `github:SteamClientHomebrew/Millennium`. This does not support git submodules which are vital in the process of building Millennium.

```nix
nixpkgs.overlay = [
  inputs.millennium.overlays.default
];
```

3. replace steam with millennium
   if you use steam NixOS module, set millennium as steam package

```nix

```

if you don't, simply replace steam with millennium in packages list.
