# Dynamic Patching

## Introduction

Dynamic patching is a feature that allows themes to conditionally inject Css/Js into Steam depending on user configuration.

## Properties

|Field|Type|Description|
|-----|:------:|-----------|
|default|`Any`|The preselected default option from `values`|
|description|`String`|A basic description of the what the config does. Supports [BB code][guide]|
|tab|`String`|Title of the custom settings tab that the option is displayed under. (optional)|
|values|`Object`|An object containing keys `yes`/`no` for checkbox config, and other string values for combobox|
|`values` item|`Object`|Contains a `TargetCss` and/or a `TargetJs` object|
|`TargetJs` & `TargetCss`|`Object`|Contains an `affects` key, and a `src` key|
|`affects`|`List<String>`|A list of regex strings that are matched against all open Steam windows. If there is a match, the TargetCss/Js will be injected into the window|
|`src`|`List<String>`|A relative path to the target Js/Css module|



## Example

In the following example, the `Conditions` key is a property top-level in your skin.json (It should be on the same level as `Patches`)
